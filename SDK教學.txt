To get set up, go to the C++ SDK on GitHub. From here, you will need to clone the C++ SDK project, or download the zipped snapshot of the code. You can either build the C++ GazeApi library manually, or include the source files directly into your own C++ project. Please note that the C++ SDK depends on Boost. For information on obtaining and installing a recent version of Boost, please consult the Boost website.

1.Install Boost libraries
 a. Download and extract the Boost source code
 b. Run bootstrap from a terminal and follow the on-screen instructions
2.Use CMake GUI to generate project files
(CMake will try to find Boost during configure. If that fails do the following)
 a. Turn on the Advanced flag
 b. Set BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR to the path of the root of Boost
 c. Configure
 d. If CMake fails to find the Boost libraries, then set BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the path of where the prebuilt libraries of Boost are located
 e. Configure
 f. Generate project files
3.Build the C++ SDK library with your preferred compiler
